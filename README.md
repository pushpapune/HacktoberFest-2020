#### Q. Are data model bias and variance a challenge with unsupervised learning? 
- [ ]  No, data model bias and variance are only a challenge with reinforcement learning. 
- [x]  Yes, data model bias is a challenge when the machine creates clusters. 
- [ ]  Yes, data model variance trains the unsupervised machine learning algorithm. 
- [ ]  No, data model bias and variance involve supervised learning.

#### Q. Which choice is best for binary classification? 
- [ ]  K-means 
- [x]  Logistic regression 
- [ ]  Linear regression 
- [ ]  Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

#### Q. With traditional programming, the programmer typically inputs commands. With machine learning, the programmer inputs 
- [ ]  supervised learning 
- [x]  data 
- [ ]  unsupervised learning 
- [ ]  algorithms

#### Q. Why is it important for machine learning algorithms to have access to high-quality data? 
- [ ]  It will take too long for programmers to scrub poor data. 
- [ ]  If the data is high quality, the algorithms will be easier to develop. 
- [ ]  Low-quality data requires much more processing power than high-quality data. 
- [x]  If the data is low quality, you will get inaccurate results.
